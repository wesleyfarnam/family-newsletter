# ðŸ“¤ How to Push Latest Changes to GitHub

## Current Status
I have prepared the latest production-ready code but cannot push directly due to Git authentication limitations in this environment.

## What You Need to Do

From your local machine, run these commands:

### Option 1: If you have the repository already
```bash
cd family-newsletter
git status
git pull origin main
```

### Option 2: If you need to get the repository fresh
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesleyfarnam/family-newsletter.git
cd family-newsletter
```

### Option 3: Force update with latest changes
If you want to ensure you have all the latest code:

```bash
# Make sure you're on main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# If you have conflicts, reset to remote
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

## Latest Changes Ready

The latest commit includes:
- âœ… Hydration warning fixes with suppressHydrationWarning
- âœ… Complete marketing website redesign  
- âœ… Production-ready authentication system
- âœ… All documentation and deployment guides

## Verify You Have Latest Code

Check that you have this commit:
```bash
git log --oneline -3
```

You should see:
```
c3f53b9 Fix hydration warnings with suppressHydrationWarning attribute
3588be5 Add deployment documentation
18c273c Complete marketing website redesign
```

## Then Proceed to Step 2

Once you have the latest code, follow the step-by-step deployment guide for Step 2 (Vercel deployment).

**If you're ready to deploy, I recommend:**
1. Pull the latest code as shown above
2. Go to Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
3. The Vercel dashboard will automatically detect and deploy the latest commit
